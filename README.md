# trbl-LicensePed
Weapon License issuing NPC for qbcore

Normally, when starting a new toon, you need to have a weapon license manually granted by a police officer (with their grantlicense command)
before you may purchase firearms from Ammunation.

The purpose of this tiny script is to free up police for other tasks and set up an NPC that does this on the police behalf.

## Installation
Just set the coords in the config whereever you want the NPC (city hall, police station etc),
choose whether you want the NPC generated via qb-target or mojito_dialogue,
and set which licenses you want available to apply for, and optionally purchase directly from the NPC.

remember to install the dependency https://github.com/Mojito-Fivem/mojito_dialogue if you're using it.
