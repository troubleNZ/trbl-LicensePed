Weapon License issuing NPC for qbcore

When starting a new toon, you need to manually have a weapon license granted by police (with their grantlicense command)
before you may purchase firearms from ammunation.

this tiny script sets up an npc that does this on the police behalf.

set the coords in the client lua whereever you want the npc (city hall, police station etc)
