Weapon License issuing NPC for qbcore

Normally, when starting a new toon, you need to have a weapon license manually granted by a police officer (with their grantlicense command)
before you may purchase firearms from Ammunation.

The purpose of this tiny script is to free up police for other tasks and set up an npc that does this on the police behalf.

##Installation
Just set the coords in the client lua whereever you want the npc (city hall, police station etc)
choose whether you want the NPC generated via qb-target or mojito_dialogue

remember to install the dependency https://github.com/Mojito-Fivem/mojito_dialogue <3
